;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This package simplifies shell management and sudo access by providing
;; the following commands.
;; 
;; `better-shell-shell'
;; --------------------
;; 
;; Cycle through existing shell buffers, in order of recent use.  If
;; there are no shells, one is created.
;; 
;; With C-u prefix arg, invoke `better-shell-for-current-dir'.
;; 
;; `better-shell-for-current-dir'
;; ------------------------------
;; 
;; Bring up a shell on the same host and in the same directory as the
;; current buffer, choosing an existing shell if possible.  The shell
;; chosen is guaranteed to be idle (not currently running a command).  It
;; first looks for an idle shell that is already in the buffer's
;; directory.  If none is found, it looks for another idle shell on the
;; same host as the buffer.  If one is found, that shell is selected and
;; automatically placed into the buffer's directory with a `cd` command.
;; Otherwise, a new shell is created on the same host and in the same
;; directory as the buffer.
;; 
;; `better-shell-remote-open'
;; --------------------------
;; 
;; Open a shell on a remote server, allowing you to choose from any host
;; you've previously logged into (uses your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file) or
;; enter a new host.  With C-u prefix arg, get sudo shell.
;; 
;; `better-shell-sudo-here'
;; --------------------------
;; 
;; Reopen the current file, directory, or shell as root.
